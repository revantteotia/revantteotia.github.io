I am a PhD student in Computer Science at [NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html). I work on problems in machine learning for healthcare with [Prof. Sumit Chopra](https://www.spchopra.org/).

I have recently completed my MS in Computer Science from [Columbia University](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/) where I worked on computer vision and multimodal learning in Prof. [Carl Vondrick's](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~vondrick/) lab. Before starting MS, I was an RA in Prof. [Anand Mishra](https://anandmishra22.github.io/)'s Vision, Language, and Learning Group ([VL2G](https://vl2g.github.io/)), [Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur](http://iitj.ac.in/). At VL2G, I worked on [knowledge-aware image retrieval](https://vl2g.github.io/projects/cofar/docs/COFAR-AACL2022.pdf) and [visual relationships](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Teotia_Few-Shot_Visual_Relationship_Co-Localization_ICCV_2021_paper.html).

Before that, I worked in the Health Service Team at [Samsung Research Institute (SRIB)](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b). There, I worked on wearable fitness devices ([CES2020 News](https://www.technogym.com/int/newsroom/samsung-watch-ces-compatible/)) and [on-device pose-estimation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8856547) for [Samsung Health Workout Programs](https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/apps/samsung-health/#programs).

I completed my B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](https://iitk.ac.in/) in 2017.
