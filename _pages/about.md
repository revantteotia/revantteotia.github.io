I am a Research Assistant in the Vision, Language, and Learning Group (VL2G) at [Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur](http://iitj.ac.in/) supervised by [Dr. Anand Mishra](https://anandmishra22.github.io/). My research interests lie in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.

Currently, I am working on the problem of Visual Entity Linking, exploring how deep neural networks could be used to link visual entities (objects, faces, and texts in images) to knowledge graph. 
I am also studying the potential of knowledge graphs in improving Visual Recognition and Visual Question Answering (VQA). 

Previously, I worked in Health Service Team at [Samsung R&D Institute Bangalore (SRIB)](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b) for 2 years. There, I worked on health and fitness tracking services (pedometer, sleep monitor, heart-rate monitor) of wearable devices and BLE/NFC communication between smartwatch and fitness machines. 
I also worked on developing an on-device pose-estimation system for [Samsung Health Workout Programs](https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/apps/samsung-health/#programs) which uses Optical Flow, Dynamic Time Warping and CNN to detect deviations from the ideal exercise pose and suggest corrections.

I completed my Bachelorsâ€™ degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](https://iitk.ac.in/) in 2017.
