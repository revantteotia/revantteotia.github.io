I am a PhD student in Computer Science at [NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html). I work on problems in computer vision and machine learning with [Prof. Sumit Chopra](https://www.spchopra.org/). I also work as a Visiting Researcher on the Fundamental AI Research team (FAIR Labs) at [Meta AI](https://ai.meta.com/research/).

I completed my MS in Computer Science from [Columbia University](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/) in 2023 where I worked on computer vision and multimodal learning in Prof. [Carl Vondrick's](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~vondrick/) lab. Before MS, I was an RA in Prof. [Anand Mishra](https://anandmishra22.github.io/)'s Vision, Language, and Learning Group ([VL2G](https://vl2g.github.io/)), [IIT Jodhpur](http://iitj.ac.in/) where I worked on [knowledge-aware image retrieval](https://vl2g.github.io/projects/cofar/docs/COFAR-AACL2022.pdf) and [visual relationships](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Teotia_Few-Shot_Visual_Relationship_Co-Localization_ICCV_2021_paper.html). Before that, I worked on wearable fitness devices in the Health Service Team at [Samsung Research Institute (SRIB)](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b). I did my B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering from [IIT Kanpur](https://iitk.ac.in/) in 2017. 

In my free time, I do sports (badminton, swimming and tennis).

My sister [Reva Teotia](https://revateotia.github.io/) is a researcher in Electrical Engineering and works on developing sensors.
